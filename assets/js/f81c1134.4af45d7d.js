To increase Go\'s market share.\\\\\\nIn conversations, the Go team made it clear to me \\nthat they don\'t want to focus on web development.\\nA segment of the market long lost to Django.\\n\\nWinning market share is a mindset that thinks in terms of competition\\nwith means: winners and losers. \\\\\\n<a href=\\"https://killedbygoogle.com/\\" title=\\"Google Graveyard\\">Want to venture a guess</a>\\nwhat happens to a project when Google has lost the market \\nor shifts their headquarters\' ORKs?\\n\\n<img src={ require(\'./2024-06-27-go-roadmap-neglecting-web-development-top-gun.gif\').default } \\n     title=\\"Competition leads to second places and losers\\" \\n     style = {{ display:\'block\', margin:\'auto\' }} />\\n\\\\\\nNow, _competition_ happens on the next hot trend.\\\\\\nBye bye web development \ud83d\udc4b \\n<span style={{ color: \'#999\'}}>and bye bye AI market \ud83d\udc4b</span>\\n\\nGoogle and other large companies focus on cloud services.\\nThey don\'t care enough about web development to make \\na real impact on the language or ecosystem.\\nSo, the question is, is there a subset of the community that cares?\\n\\n## Arrower for Web Development in Go\\nLarge companies create microservices.\\nThis work demands teams and budgets larger \\nthan those of typical small projects.\\nNot caring about resources and addressing problems of scale is not aiding \\nsolo developers and small teams building web applications. \\nArrower is an effort to address this:\\n\\nFirst, by a building mindset!\\nThis is more constructive compared to a competitive head-to-head \\nof gaining market share. \\nBuilding allows a long term perspective on web development,\\nand it brings lasting motivation and innovation.\\n\\nSecond, Arrower challenges some of the long-held conventions \\nof the Go community to simplify web development by being:\\n* a framework that brings common building blocks together in a \\n  cohesive manner but avoids known framework traps.\\n* quick and productive for (MVP) development in Go, \\n  matching up to Django and Rails.\\n* focused on domain supporting abstractions and rethinking long-held biases, \\n  e.g. against reflection.\\n\\n\\\\\\nArrower brings modern web development trends and developer productivity to Go. \\nThis includes innovations like hot reload long adopted by other languages, \\nwhile it avoids known traps. \\nThere\'s a reason after all why Go developers don\'t like frameworks \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://github.com/go-arrower/arrower\\" title=\\"Arrower on GitHub\\">Check out Arrower</a>\\nand join the effort to make web development in Go more feasible and fun."}]}}')}}]);
