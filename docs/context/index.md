# Contexts

Arrower provides a set of Contexts, that help you to get started quickly with commonly required functionality.

The name `Context` is taken from DDD and indicates that this are clearly separated parts of the code.
You might think of them as a component in a component architecture, or a module in a majestic modular monolith, or
a service in a microservice architecture.

Each Context is optional, and you don't need it to run your application.
Currently, the deployment of an arrower application happens in a single deployable unit, 
but you can imagine each Context could be deployed independently in the future.
