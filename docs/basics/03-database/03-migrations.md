# Migrations

Use of migrate as tool
Why explicit migration?
* advantages
  * explicit & max. control (no magic)
  * sql
* disadvantages
  * version numbers

Outline:
* run migration to create db tables
* link to migration files in github (and preview up)
* Hint: use favorite migration tool. Arrower uses go-migrate
* Table reference
* Recommendation: vacuum table and example with schedule
