# Enabling Go for Web Development

* Go's advantages as a language make it compelling to use in many places also for web sites
  * focuses on cli and server development
  * Go is not build for web development
  * Driving force: solo developer or small team but still use the speed, type safety, and tooling the language offers
* Google and the community do not care enough about web development
  * Do microservices (team size and money are different)
  * Google wants to compete and gain market share
  * => mindset leads to winners and losers and is not constructive
  * Go team made it clear on GopherCon Europe that they don't want to focus on it
* Arrower is a framework to address this
  * focuses on building (constructive instead of head-to-head)
    * => long term motivation instead of closing down if maret is lost
  * does not solve all problems (focus on small to mid-size and building)
    * => breaks with conventions:
      * framework (building blocks that fit together)
      * enable modern web development trends (js hot reload)
      * conventions over configuration to be quick 
      * use of reflection & focus on domain supporting abstractions (instead of wiring together code)
      * at te same time: keep issues at bay, why Go developers do not like frameworks
