# Enabling Go for Web Development

Although Go is build for cli and server development 
Go's advantages (name them here) as a language make it compelling to use in many places also for web sites
  * In many places Go is not build / optimised for web development
  * This is an issue for solo developer or small teams that need to build & ship websites
    but still use the speed, type safety, and tooling the language offers
  * Go feels a lot like any other scripting language used for web-development but without the issues
* Google and the enterprises in the cloud space do not care enough about web development (what about the community?)
  * They do microservices (team size and money are different)
  * Google wants to compete in the cloud and AI markets of programming languages to gain market share
  * => mindset leads to winners and losers and is not constructive (Top Gun quote)
  * Go team made it clear on GopherCon Europe that they don't want to focus on web dev

The mindset of competition instead of building and the problems of large companies like Google et al. are a problem 
for solo devs and small teams:
* Arrower is a framework to address the issues
  * focuses on building (constructive instead of head-to-head)
    * => long term motivation instead of closing down if maret is lost or quarterly OKRs change
  * does not solve all problems (focus on small to mid-size and building attitude)
    * => breaks with conventions:
      * framework (building blocks that fit together) and tries to avoid some of the common issues other frameworks have
      * conventions over configuration to be quick
      * focus on domain supporting abstractions (instead of wiring together code) and accepting reflections to get there
    * enable / bring modern web development trends & DX to Go (js hot reload)
    * at te same time: keep issues at bay, why Go developers do not like frameworks

CTA
* check out Arrower and join the community effort to make web dev in Go more feasible
